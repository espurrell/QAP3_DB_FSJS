Class lectures. Co Pilot to generate the styles/css and also the content of the baked items. Co Pilot and Chat GPT for bug fixes

No.

you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

No.

some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.1.


This was a hard one for me, unsure if I just didnt grasp the material as well but I did find it a challenge to complete, there were more bug fixes I had to complete in this QAP than most Sprint
